##### Research Assistant/March 2023 - Present
•	Conducted literature research to identify relevant papers in biology and mathematics to support the development of an LSTM model with a novel memory consumption loss function for biologically plausible cell memory studies
•	Trained 1,000 cells using the novel LSTM model, resulting in trajectory samples that closely align with experimental observations, surpassing the performance of traditional LSTM models
