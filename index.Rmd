### This is Zheshu Jiang's awesome website
Hi, this is Zheshu Jiang! I am a first-year biostatistics MS student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 
I'm a master at pretending to be productive while secretly binging Netflix. 
Take a happy time browsing my little rough first personal website! You can find my past experience, email, GitHub page, and LinkedIn page by clicking on the upper right icons. Feel free to send me gift cards and promo codes :)
